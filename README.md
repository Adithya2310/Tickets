## Overview
I have made a Dapp using Ganache and Truffle.
## Prerequisites

You need a local ganache environment running and you need a solidity compiler of 0.5.1v for compiling the smart contracts 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Truffle Framework](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle)
- [Solidity Compiler 0.5.1](https://soliditylang.org/)
- Ethereum Development Environment (e.g., [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache), [Infura](https://infura.io/), or a testnet)
- You need to run the frontend
